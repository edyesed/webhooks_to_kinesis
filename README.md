# Webhooks to Kinesis
Perhaps you want to be able to take in arbitrary webhooks, and then do whatever
the hell you want to do with those events afterwards. ( pair this with [edyesed/kinesis-lambda-notifier](github.com/edyesed/kinesis-lambda-notifier)

There are tactical, if not strategic, reasons one might not want to handline input and output in something like a lambda ( multiplexing, asynchronous processing ). Or maybe you're willing to drink some [CQRS koolaid](http://www.confluent.io/blog/event-sourcing-cqrs-stream-processing-apache-kafka-whats-connection/).

:farnsworth: Good News Everyone! AWS makes this crazy easy. 

## Setup Stream + API Gateway ( inputs )
The way this system will work is input comes from API gateway to Kinesis Stream.

### Create an IAM user to create the stream and api gateway
0. Create an IAM user ( can delete after making these resources )
1. Copy the credentials
2. Attach this policy to the user
    1.  AdministratorAccess

### Run the script and build the Stream + API gateway ( or read it )
0. `./bin/build_pieces.sh`


### Delete that IAM user
0.  Use Console

### Find your API URL
0. [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
0. Services
0. API Gateway
0. APIs
0. webhooks_to_kinesis
0. Stages
0. Prod
0. island-streams
0. POST

### POST something in
1. `curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"this": "works"}' https://UR_URL_GOES_HERE.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/islandstreams`
2. Get back something like this? üê≥

     ```
{"SequenceNumber":"11111111999999222222333333333333333333000000066666666677","ShardId":"shardId-000000000000"}
     ```
